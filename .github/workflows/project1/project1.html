<h2>CMST 386 - SEO Best Practices, Accessibility, User Engagement</h2>

<div class="w3-container"> 
    
<h3>1. Describe how search engines work:</h3>
    <p>Search engines "crawl" website links using bots and sift through that webiste's code. 
    Selected pieces of that code are then recorded and kept in a large database where they're 
    stored for when that information shows up in a search query.</p>

<h3>2. Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags:</h3>
    <p>Keywords are one of the most imporant pieces to the search process. When bots crawl websites, they store information
        in databases determined and organized by particular keywords. Keywords are used to determine the relevance of your websites
        content to whatever a person is searching on an search engine. Example: if someone is searching for a chocolate chip cookie recipe,
        it would be wise to have "chocolate chip cookie recipe" (any and all of those words) on your website.
    </p>

<h3>3. List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links:</h3>
    <p>According to “SEO: The Free Beginner’s Guide From Moz”</br>
        -Links should provide alt text for images. Assigning images in .gif, .png, .jpg format gives search engines a text description of the visual content. </br>
        -Links should supplement search boxes. Supplements include navigation and crawlable links.</br>
        -Links should supplement flash or java plug-ins.</br>
        -Links should provide a transcript for video and audio content. Ideally if/when the words used are meant to be indexed/searched by the engines. </br>
        </p>

<h3>4. What consititues good heading heirarchy and include an example with 
    more than one heading tag:</h3>
    <p>  Heading should be logically structured in a hierarchy on a webpage starting with h1 and adding
        subsections down to h6. Headings should not be skipped and should be written in ascending
        or descending order. As the numbers indicate, h1 should be the largest and h6 should be the
        smallest, indicating which information is meant to draw attention and keep attention
        (as well as items that are not as important). You may have multiple of each heading while
        keeping in mind which information is most important for the viewer. A great exmaple of this is the current webpage. 
        The title of the page (CMST 386) is larger than the content. Even within the content, the quesitons are larger than
        the answers.
